# Off Board Blink
This project is the blinking of two LEDs on a breadboard utilizing the MSP430G2553 chip. This was done by having a for-loop 
toggle outputs at different frequencies and output the values to pins. These pins were then connected to the anode of the LEDs in order to control the blinking.
